#A small tutorial for a small program (the programs name is syms)
#
#This file can be executed by calling ./../syms user_manual
#(the program interprets input until it reaches "exit")
#when file is finised, if exit was not provided to the interpreter 
#the program will fall back on standard input
#
#Lines that start with a hash are ignored
#You can assign an expression to a symbol:
a = x + y
#Now to access it's content:
b = !a*(z + t)
#Note the difference:
c = a*(z+t)
#You can write an expression without assigning it. It will be
#assigned by default to the symbol "ans"
!b*(1+q)
#You can differentiate an expression:
diff = D[x, x*(x+1)]
#Unfortunatley, symbols can not be expanded inside differentials
#Just don't design a spacecraft using this program!
#When finished, type:
exit
